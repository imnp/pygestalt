# Introduction

We believe that anyone should be able to build their own custom digital fabrication tools. Why? [Read our philosophy here.](/pages/philosophy)

pyGestalt helps you construct and configure control systems for your own automated machines, ranging from simple to crazy. Just two examples: [a plotter that writes love letters](https://vimeo.com/12068389), and an [augmented Jacquard loom for weaving friendship bracelets](https://vimeo.com/70206561) ([including a web-based control system](http://www.friendshiploom.com)). We've observed that for most machine builders, the control system is the hardest element to take from 0 -> 1. Mechanics can start with humble hardware-store beginnings and be improved later. Moving your multi-axis machine in a coordinated manner, perhaps with a custom tool-head or sensors, is tougher to get off the ground.
