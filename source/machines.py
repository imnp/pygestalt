# pyGestalt Machines Library

"""A collection of classes for building machine-level objects.

In the model implemented by pyGestalt, nodes encapuslate hardware-level functionality at a very elemental level.
For example, a stepper motor driver is abstracted as a software object with API methods for e.g. taking a certain
number of steps. When you incorporate a stepper motor into a machine, however, the number of steps no longer has
direct meaning to the user. Rather, they care about the position of the machine (most likely in real-world units like
mm or inches.) This machines library provides classes for building object-oriented machine definitions (to borrow a phrasing
coined by Nadya Peek).
